### TIS-100 CPU in VHDL

Work in progress.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/jdryg/tis100cpu/wiki) for details (mostly thoughts of a possible implementation atm).

I use Xilinx ISE Webpack for development and testing. I try to keep testbench files up to date, but don't count on it. Hopefully the end result will be synthesizable on a small/cheap FPGA. Currently, I don't have an FPGA, so don't count on that either :)
